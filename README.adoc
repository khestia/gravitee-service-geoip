== Description

You must use the `service-geoip` when you need to load the `geoip` databases in memory, so you need to adjust the JVM Heap settings of your AM or APIM Gateways accordingly.
It's required to use the `geoip-filtering` policy in APIM and for `Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication` in AM.

== Compatibility

If you use an APIM < 3.10, only 1.0.x versions are compatible
